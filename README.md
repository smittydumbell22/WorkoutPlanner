# Workout Plan Database

I wanted to try making a program with a database for workouts. Sometimes it is difficult if you have been doing the same few workouts for a number of roataions. It was my hope that people could use this program to specify the muscle group they would like to workout and the type of weight they prefer, then they would be able to choose from a variety of workouts that are specific to those two things. 

This program uses SQL and Python. The user is able to view the workouts, add more workouts with the options to choose between a barbell and dumbells, and to choose the muscle group they would like to workout as well.

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
* [python](https://www.python.org/)

# Future Work


* I would build out the code so the user can add reps and amount of weight
* I would make the client side interface (something polished that looks nice)
